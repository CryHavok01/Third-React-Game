# React Game
My latest React creation is a much more complex game.  It is currently playable start to finish, but is still a work in progress and will be updated with new features as I complete them.

The game is essentially a text-based adventure game that uses an interface similar to the 90's LucasArts adventure games (bonus points if you ever played The Secret of Monkey Island) with buttons representing different verbs you can use to interact with the environment.  The game provides a text description of your environment, and objects you can interact with are presented as buttons.  The game also has a (very limited, for now) inventory system that allows you to pick up items and use them with objects in the environment to solve puzzles.  In it's current state, the game is fully playable, although very short.  My first priority was making sure each system works correctly, and my next will be expanding the game to provide more variety and more challenging puzzles.

In its current state, the game is presented with pure HTML and has no CSS styling.  Once the game is in a more finished state, I intend to style the game to be more visually interesting and easier to follow.  The current version is playable here: https://cryhavok01.github.io/Third-React-Game/
